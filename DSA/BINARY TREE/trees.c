// Its not an linear data structure
// immediate predecessor is bacially parent node and immediate succesor is child node 
// trees are collection to entites(nodes) linked together to stimulate a hierarchy
// node which dont have any child is called leaf node or external node 
// Non leaf node are which have atleast one child or also called as internal node 
// Root is the very first node 
// Ancestor node is any predecessor node on the path from root to the node 
// degree of node is the no .of child of that node 
// degree of tree max degree of node present tree
// depth of node is length from root to that node(no of edges) (level of node is also same)
// depth of root node is always zero
// height of node is max length till its leaf node
// max no of nodes possible at height n is 2^n
// total number of nodes for height h is 2^(h+1)-1 and min is h+1.
// max height is n-1 (n=no .of nodes).
// min height is log(n+1)-1(for base 2).
